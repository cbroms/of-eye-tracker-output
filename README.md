# Eye Tracker Output

This program uses the output information from the [eye tracker program](https://github.com/cbroms/of-eye-tracker) to save individual images cropped around the region that someone has looked at. The image sequence can be used to create a video showing where people looked around an image. 

Built with openFrameworks.
